## Challenge Summary - Linked List Insertions

### Challenge Description - LL Insertions

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

### Approach & Efficiency - LL Insertions

I started out by whiteboarding the problem domain and then planned each step of my algorithms. Then I wrote some tests and then wrote code that passed my tests and matched my algorithms.
