# Queue with Stacks

## Challenge Summary - Queue with Stacks

[<--- Back to Table of Contents](../../../README.md)

### Challenge Description - Queue with Stacks Implementation

* Create a PseudoQueue class

* implements standard queue interface with enqueue and dequeue methods

* internally only uses 2 stack objects

### Approach & Efficiency - Queue with Stacks Implementation

I reviewed the methods and properties of my stack implementation and then implemented a queue with two stacks and added its methods. Then I created unit tests to satisfy the following requirements:

#### Instance of PseudoQueue class can:

* enqueue into a queue

* enqueue multiple values into a queue

* dequeue out of a queue the expected value

* peek into a queue, seeing the expected value

* empty a queue after multiple dequeues

* instantiate an empty queue

* Calling dequeue or peek on empty queue raises exception
